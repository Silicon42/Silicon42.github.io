I was finally convinced to make a blog <!-- truncate -->
since all the popular and employable programmers seem to be doing it. I'll try 
to post at least once a week here with musings on my projects, programming in 
general, math, maker things and probably other stuff as well. Here's hoping that 
someone finds my assorted insights and ramblings useful.
